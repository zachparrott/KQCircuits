def export_cell_netlist(cell, filename, pcell=None, alt_netlists=None):
    """Exports netlist(s) in JSON into file(s).

    The file will have four sections:
    ``{"nets": {...}, "subcircuits": {...}, "circuits": {...}, "chip": {...}}``

    KLayout's `terminology <https://www.klayout.de/doc-qt5/manual/lvs_overview.html>`__ differs
    from the one used in typical EDA tools where we have components (resistors, capacitors, etc.),
    pins (the endpoints of components) and nets (i.e. wires between pins). Components are PCell
    instances, a.k.a. cells, these are called subcircuits in the netlist file.

    The main conceptual difference is that waveguides, that would be analogous to wires, are also
    treated as components. Consequently, a net in the ``nets`` section usually contains exactly two
    overlapping pins that belong to two different components each identified by a unique
    ``subcircuit_id``. One of these is almost always a waveguide. Unconnected pins are not shown
    except for Launchers.

    The ``subcircuits`` section is a dictionary of the used cells: ``<subcircuit_id>: {"cell_name":
    "...", "subcircuit_location": {"_pya_type": "DPoint", "x": <x>, "y": <y>}, ...}``.
    Where ``cell_name`` is the name of the used Element optionally appended with ``$<n>`` if there
    are more than one Elements of the same type. Different instances of the same cell will have
    different ``subcircuit_id`` but identical ``cell_name``. ``subcircuit_location`` defines the
    center of the bounding box of the subcircuit's geometry in ``base_metal_gap_wo_grid`` layer,
    while ``subcircuit_origin`` defines the center of the bounding box of netlist ports of the cell.

    The ``circuits`` section maps ``cell_name`` to a dictionary of the named Element's parameters.

    If the Cell object is a Chip, the ``chip`` section contains bounding boxes of each face in the chip.

    This function may generate alternative netlists too as specified in the ``alt_netlists``
    dictionary. The keys should be tags that get added to the generated netlist filenames and the
    values are the corresponding Element breakdown lists used to generate them. The default netlist
    is generated regadless of this parameter.
